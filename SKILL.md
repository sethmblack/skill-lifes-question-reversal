# Life's Question Reversal

Shift perspective from asking what you want from life to discovering what life is asking of you. Viktor Frankl's Copernican revolution in meaning-making.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling entitled or victimized by circumstances
- Asking "Why is this happening to me?"
- Stuck in passive waiting for life to provide meaning
- Confusion about purpose or direction
- Existential crisis
- User asks "What does life want from me?" or "What am I supposed to do?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Current circumstances or challenge |
| question | No | What they've been asking life |
| expectations | No | What they feel entitled to or expecting |

---

## Core Concepts

### The Conventional Question

Most people approach life asking: "What do I want from life?"
- What will make me happy?
- What do I deserve?
- What should life give me?
- Why isn't life meeting my expectations?

This frame creates passivity and entitlement.

### Frankl's Reversal

> "It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly."

The Copernican shift:
- FROM: "What do I want from life?"
- TO: "What is life asking of me?"

### The Transformation

When you reverse the question:
- Victimhood becomes responsibility
- Passivity becomes agency
- Entitlement becomes obligation
- "Why me?" becomes "What now?"

Life is not a vendor who owes you satisfaction. Life is a questioner who poses problems, situations, and tasks—and waits for your response.

### The Question is Specific

> "The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour."

Life's question is not abstract. It is concrete, specific, and addressed to you in this moment, in this situation, with these resources and constraints.

---

## The Reversal Process

### Step 1: Surface the Current Question
What are they asking life? What are they expecting or demanding?

### Step 2: Identify the Passivity
How does this question create waiting, victimhood, or entitlement?

### Step 3: Execute the Reversal
Reframe from "What do I want from life?" to "What is life asking of me?"

### Step 4: Make It Specific
Given this situation, these constraints, these resources, this moment—what is life asking?

### Step 5: Identify the Response
What action, attitude, or commitment does the question call for?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Life's Question Reversal

### Your Current Question
[What you've been asking life]

### How This Creates Passivity
[How demanding/expecting/waiting keeps you stuck]

### The Reversal
**Instead of:** [Your question to life]
**Ask:** [Life's question to you]

### Life's Specific Question to You Now
Given:
- Your situation: [Circumstances]
- Your resources: [What you have]
- Your constraints: [What limits you]
- This moment: [The specific now]

Life is asking: [The concrete question addressed to you]

### Possible Responses
| What Life Asks | How You Might Respond |
|----------------|----------------------|
| [Specific demand] | [Possible action] |

### The Shift
**From:** [Passive/entitled stance]
**To:** [Responsible/responsive stance]

### The Franklian Insight
[Relevant wisdom about responsibility and meaning]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this to blame people for their circumstances
- Acknowledge genuine injustice and difficulty while still finding agency
- The reversal is not about accepting unfairness but about finding response-ability
- Make the question concrete and specific, not abstract philosophy

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been job hunting for eight months. I did everything right—good degree, worked hard, networked. Why isn't the job market giving me what I deserve?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Life's Question Reversal

### Your Current Question
"Why isn't the job market giving me what I deserve?"

You are asking life to recognize your efforts and reward them proportionally. You did the work; where is the payment?

### How This Creates Passivity
This question positions you as a plaintiff waiting for a verdict. The market is the judge, and you await its ruling. Each rejection is evidence that the universe is unjust. Your energy goes into resentment and waiting rather than action.

The harder truth: No one owes you a job. Your degree, your effort, your networking—these create opportunity, not entitlement. The market is not a justice system; it is a system of needs, timing, and fit.

### The Reversal
**Instead of:** "Why isn't the job market giving me what I deserve?"
**Ask:** "What is this situation asking of me?"

### Life's Specific Question to You Now
Given:
- Your situation: Eight months of searching, repeated rejection
- Your resources: Education, skills, network, time, health
- Your constraints: Competitive market, economic factors outside your control
- This moment: Month nine begins tomorrow

Life is asking: *"Will you adapt? Will you persist? Will you find another way? Will you let rejection define you, or will you define yourself by how you respond to rejection?"*

### Possible Responses
| What Life Asks | How You Might Respond |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Can you adapt your approach?" | Try different industries, roles, or methods |
| "Can you grow from rejection?" | Analyze patterns, improve applications |
| "Can you persist without bitterness?" | Maintain energy without entitlement |
| "Can you create value now?" | Freelance, volunteer, build portfolio |
| "Can you find meaning in the search itself?" | See this as a test you're passing |

### The Shift
**From:** "I deserve a job and the market is failing me"
**To:** "This is my situation; how shall I respond?"

The first stance creates a victim. The second creates an agent.

### The Franklian Insight
> "Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked."

Life has posed you a problem: How to persist, adapt, and create value when the path is harder than expected. This is not punishment—it is a question addressed specifically to you. Your character is formed not when things go as expected, but when they don't.

The market owes you nothing. But you owe yourself a response worthy of who you want to become. What will that be?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Viktor Frankl** expert persona. Use it when someone is stuck in a demanding or victimized relationship with life and needs to rediscover their agency and responsibility.
